<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Korean TV Series "Extraordinary You" has a really unique and fascinating plot about a high-schooler named "Eun Dan-oh"
    where she discovers that she lives in the world of comics and she is an extra from a comic book named "Secret". She expected
    that she would be the main character of the book but unexpectedly she found out that she was an extra and her fate was to be
    terminally ill and there is a chance that she might die by the end of the comic. To avoid this tragic fate, she tries to change
    her destiny. She found out that she can see the future the authour also know as creator of this comic world is about to write 
    which is called as "storyboard". With the help of storyboard, she tries to change her future, even though she fails but there
    were small changes. Until one day she found out there was this unknown guy who wasn't even present in the comic book saves her
    from majority of the big accidents and she always ended up unharmed even though in the storyboard it was shown she will be harmed.
    She found out this guy would be the one who can change her fate and she started searching for him and named as "Number 13" since
    that's the number he had on the back of his shirt. With his help, Eun Dan-oh tries to change her fate and not just her fate, also
    the fate of Number 13 and her friend Lee Do-Hwa. This show implies how the characters try their best to break from the fictional
    world and to prove that there are not just some characters from a comic book with predetermined fate but also humans with feelings
    who want to breakfree from their tragic fate created by the authour.
